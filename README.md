# -PetaLinux-Python-Integration-on-Zynq-UltraScale-ZCU104-
 This project demonstrates how to integrate Python 3 and its core modules into a custom PetaLinux build using a hardware design exported from Vivado as an .xsa file. It provides a lightweight embedded Linux environment for running Python-based AI/ML or control applications directly on the Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC platform
